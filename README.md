# AMS 380 (Data Mining, Stonybrook) : Final Project
Description : This project is to perform and compare Machine Learning notions such as the ridge regression, lasso, random
forest, boosted tree, single-layer neural network and multi-layer neural network, using the MNIST data on a classification problem based on handwritten digits. At the end of the project, add a conclusion on which method is most accurate with respect to test misclassification rate.
